# Criteria for Judging Information Sources #

When using these resources on Information Literacy, one should judge them based on the criteria below. The criteria is meant to define how one can determine the credibility and usuability of these sources.  

* The information source defines or explains what information literacy is and how it can be understood (Levitov, 2004).

* The information source explores one of the multi-faceted explanations for information literacy and understands that there is not one concrete definition to define the entire field of information literacy (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011). 

* The information source provides a logical understanding of information literacy and how it has changed and will continue to change with the advent of technology (Jacobson & O'Keeffe, 2014).

* Online sources contain information or links that may change as time passes. When researching via online sources, key elements to look for in a website that affect quality are source, qualifications and credentials, conflict of interest, currency, purpose, relevance, accuracy, context, scope and totality of topic, disclaimers, design, and links to other materials (Veronin, 2005, p. 211).

* In regards to academic journals, one can evaluate the quality of the research and whether the journal is high quality. Characteristics we can look for in high quality journals are peer review status, number of collective articles (articles with more than one author), number of subscribers to the journal, and whether the journal is on a recognized lists of publications i.e. Institute of Scientific Information Master Journal List (Clyde, 2004, p. 1120).

* Adding to the terms of evaluating Journal Articles, each member of the group should make sure the article is written by an authoritative author and/or publisher. One can do so my researching the author's credentials or the publisher's webpage to be certain. (VSU, 2019).
